# Lead Generation Framework — The Free Audit Funnel

**Type:** B2B Lead Generation
**Best for:** Freelancers, agencies, consultants, service businesses
**Typical conversion rate:** 15–35% of landing page visitors

---

## Why This Works

The Free Audit Funnel is the highest-converting B2B lead generation system for service businesses because it:

1. **Delivers immediate value** — the prospect gets something useful before spending a penny
2. **Pre-qualifies the lead** — someone who requests an audit has a problem and is looking for a solution
3. **Establishes expertise** — the quality of your audit IS your sales pitch
4. **Creates natural follow-up** — you have a genuine reason to reach back out

## The Full System

### Step 1 — The Offer Page

**Headline formula:** "Get a Free [X] Audit — [Specific Outcome] in [Timeframe]"

Examples:
- "Get a Free Website Audit — See exactly why you're losing leads in 48 hours"
- "Free SEO Audit — Find the gaps costing you Google rankings"
- "Free Automation Audit — Identify 5 hours of work you could eliminate this week"

**Page must include:**
- [ ] Specific deliverable (what exactly they get)
- [ ] Timeframe (when they get it)
- [ ] Social proof (even one testimonial)
- [ ] Simple form — name, email, website URL only
- [ ] What happens next (set expectation, reduce anxiety)

### Step 2 — The Thank You Page

Do not waste this page. Most people ignore it. Don't.

**Thank you page must:**
- [ ] Confirm what happens next and when
- [ ] Offer a secondary CTA ("While you wait, read this →")
- [ ] Optionally: book a call directly (for warmer leads)

### Step 3 — The Audit Delivery (Your Secret Weapon)

The audit itself is where you win or lose the client.

**Structure every audit with:**

```
01 / Executive Summary (3 bullet points maximum)
       What's working · What's broken · The biggest opportunity

02 / Findings (scored 1–10 per category)
       Each finding: what it is, why it matters, what to fix

03 / Priority Matrix
       Quick wins (high impact, low effort) listed first

04 / Recommended Next Steps
       3 specific actions — the third one involves working with you
```

**Delivery format:** A clean PDF or Notion page. Never a raw document. Presentation signals professionalism before a word is read.

### Step 4 — The Follow-up Sequence

```
Day 0  → Audit delivered + personal note
Day 2  → "Did you get a chance to review?" + one quick win tip
Day 5  → Case study relevant to their industry
Day 9  → Soft CTA: "Happy to walk through this on a 20-min call"
Day 14 → Final follow-up: "Closing your file — last chance to chat"
```

**Automation:** Build this entire sequence in n8n. Zero manual sending.

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Auditing everything** — pick one thing (website, SEO, automation). Specialists convert better than generalists.

❌ **Delivering late** — if you promise 48 hours, deliver in 24. Speed signals how you'll work as a partner.

❌ **Making it too long** — 5-page audit outperforms 20-page audit. Overwhelm ≠ value.

❌ **Not following up** — 80% of deals close after the 5th touchpoint. Most freelancers stop at 1.
